# FlyoutDiscord
Makes [Discord](https://discordapp.com/login) extra compact with a flyout channel bar and less whitespace

This is intended for use with the Dark Compact Discord theme via [Stylus](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus) (target discordapp.com) and may not work properly with other themes.

If you only want parts of this style, the comments should guide you on what to remove to achieve your desired effect.
